# Backend Design
The complicated relationship between classes, levels and skills means there should be a good way to organize it all, and be able to update it in the future or allow it to be modified. To make this the most accessible, the game will use a local database to be able to query and find what it needs. The database will be populated from data files (probably JSON since its easiest) and then any changes can be made to the data files, and any modifications/additions can be added as new files.

Find information about the expected data formats in their own files.  the game systems for clarification about how classes, levels and skills work.
