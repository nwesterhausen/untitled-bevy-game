# Leveling

Doing anything in the game should provide some experience. A similar system is in Oblivion, where running helps athletitcs and jumping helps acrobatics. Also similar is Skyrim with how blocking with a shield levels block and wearing light/medium/heavy armor levels up that category. However, one big difference between the Elder Scrolls leveling is in those games, the player levels-up overall only when leveling up "skills" but here we will have all experience apply to both.

## Gaining Experience

Performing an action results in the award of some amount of experience tagged with appropriate classes for the action. If the action is the _main_ action for a class, a 250% bonus applies to the experience towards that class. Some examples:

| Action                             | Exp | Class Tags                                               | Main Class |
| ---------------------------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Swing sword at monster & damage it | 5   | warrior, defender, guard, militia, swordsman, adventurer |            |
| Bake Bread                         | 5   | cook, chef, baker                                        | baker      |
