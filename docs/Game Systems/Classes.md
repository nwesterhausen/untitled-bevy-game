Characters level up in classes separately than their overall character level. Leveling up in classes is what grants skills, and these should be preferential to what the character did to gain experience towards the class leveling up.

There should be a class for any conceivable action to take. There are different tiers of classes, and as they are leveled up, it possible for them to advance to the next tier.

| Tier | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Level 0, "Meddling" | The simpliest level of skill. If the character level is too low or the tasks done too simple then this is the tier of class gained | "Meal Maker" or "Hitter" |
| Level 1, "Apprentice" | Gained when actions are being taken under direction of someone with the class. | "Appentice Baker" or "Warrior Trainee" |
| Level 2, "General" | A standard tier for classes. Most gained are of this type. | "Baker" or "Warrior" |
| Level 3, "Specialized" | An advanced tier for classes. General tier can evolve into this type, but can skip straight to "Master" tier in special circumstances. This tier is seen nearly as much as "General" | "Break Baker" or "Spearman" |
| Level 4, "Master" | This tier is gained when a character has become one of the top percentile of their class. | "Master Baker" or "Spearmaster" |
| Level 5, "Reknown" | Tier is gained when a character has popularity or done something to stand out. | "Wandering Baker" or "Dual Spear Warrior" |
| Level 6, "Bestown" | A special tier of class that is given to a character by another. | "Royal Baker" or "Spearmaster of $Country" |
